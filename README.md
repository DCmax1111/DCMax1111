## Hi there 👋

I’m a student and builder who loves turning ideas into working code.  
Most of what I do right now is exploring **Python, machine learning, and data projects** — learning as I go and sharing what I build.  

---

### 🚀 What I’m working on  
- Laptop Price Prediction (cleaning data, EDA, baseline models, deployment prep)  
- Experimenting with ML workflows in Jupyter notebooks  
- Slowly sharpening my coding consistency and project structure  

---

### 📂 Some projects you’ll find here  
- **Laptop Price Prediction DC** → predicting laptop prices with Linear Regression & Random Forest  
- **Mini utilities** → helper scripts, testing ideas, trying new libraries  
- More small experiments as I keep learning  

---

### 🛠️ Tech I use  
- **Languages:** Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- **Tools:** VSCode, Git, Jupyter  
- **Still exploring:** PyTorch, Streamlit, automation tools  

---

### ✨ Note  
I’m not trying to look perfect here — this is just me **learning in public**, pushing code as I grow, and building piece by piece.
